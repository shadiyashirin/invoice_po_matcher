AI-Powered Invoice & Purchase Order Matching Tool
This project is a web-based application built with Django and powered by Google's Generative AI. It allows users to upload an invoice and a corresponding purchase order (in PDF or image format) and automatically compares them to find discrepancies.The tool intelligently extracts key information such as invoice/PO numbers, vendor/issuer names, line items (including descriptions and quantities), and total amounts. It then performs a sophisticated, business-logic-aware comparison to approve the match or flag specific issues for review.Key FeaturesFile Upload: Accepts both PDF and image files for invoices and purchase orders.Hybrid Text Extraction: Uses PyMuPDF for fast and accurate text extraction from digital PDFs and Tesseract OCR for scanned image-based documents.AI-Powered Data Parsing: Leverages Google's Generative AI (Gemini) to understand the unstructured text and extract structured data in a reliable JSON format, eliminating the need for brittle regex.Intelligent Comparison Logic:Matches invoice numbers against Purchase Requisition (PR) numbers.Compares partial IDs, ignoring company-specific prefixes.Cross-references vendor and issuer names for a more robust match.Compares line items based on normalized descriptions and quantities.Secure API Key Handling: Uses a .env file to keep the Google AI API key secure and out of the codebase.Clear UI: Presents a clean, concise summary of the comparison results, highlighting matches and detailing any discrepancies found.Technology StackBackend: Python, DjangoAI: Google Generative AI (Gemini) via google-generativeai SDKText Extraction: PyMuPDF (for PDFs), Pytesseract (for OCR on images)Frontend: HTML, Bootstrap 5Security: python-dotenv for environment variable managementGetting StartedFollow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.PrerequisitesPython 3.8+Tesseract OCR Engine (required by pytesseract)Windows: Install from Tesseract at UB Mannheim and ensure the installation directory is in your system's PATH.macOS: brew install tesseractLinux (Ubuntu): sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocrA Google AI API Key.
